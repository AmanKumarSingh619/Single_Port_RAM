# Single Port RAM

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a **Single Port RAM module**, complete with advanced features, a testbench, and a simulation-ready environment.

---

## Features

- **Write Masking**: Allows selective bit-level writes.
- **ECC**: Basic error detection via parity or Hamming code.
- **Low-Power Mode**: Disables operations to save power.
- **Burst Mode**: Supports sequential read/write operations.
- **Reset Initialization**: Preloads memory with default or file-based values.
